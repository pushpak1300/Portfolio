title: I'm Pushpak Chhajed
---

I'm an undergrad student in the Department of Information Technology at
Fr.CRCE, Mumbai.🎓
<br />
I'm currently exploring the field of web-application security, which seems
fascinating to me. I usually attend
<a href="https://devfolio.co/@pushpak1300" class="text-gray-900 font-semibold">hackathons</a>
during weekends and take part in
<a href="https://www.stopstalk.com/user/profile/pushpak1300" class="text-gray-900 font-semibold">
    programming contests
</a>
regularly.
<br />
In short, I like to build and break apps.😏
